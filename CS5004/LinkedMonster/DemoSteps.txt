Check all syntax by compiling the code

1. Examine the driver file LinkedMonsters
	1.1 Compile singularly
	1.3 What's the purpose of each file?

2. Establish MonsterListI interface
	2.1 manually add the described functions
	2.2 which files implement this interface?
	2.3 establish compile all

3. Fix the implementation constructors (don't forget to compile as you go)
	3.1 create the required class variables
	3.2 create a no argument constructor 
	3.3 create the argument constructors

4. Establish a node and an empty node to continue
	4.1 review an empty node to see if any changes are needed
	4.2 review a node and make the needed changes to the constructor
	4.3 compile all and check to see if you've broken anything

5. Add the ability to print a monster list so you can test
	3.1 make sure you can print a monster
	3.2 the base of your list is a node so add the ability to print a node
	(You'll need to use recursion here.) 
	3.3 create a list with a single monster and test with a print
	
6. Add the ability to add a monster
	6.1 put the addMonster lines in to the driver
	6.2 implement the addMonster method
	6.3 compile, check, and test with print

7. Add the ability to count monsters
	7.1 add the count ability to MonsterListImp
	7.2 fix empty node
	7.3 fix node
	7.4 test

8. Add the ability to get a retrieve a specific monster given a position
	8.1 create a test in the driver
	8.2 implement impl, emptyNode, and node

9. Add/check the ability for a monster to take damage
	9.1 check this functionality
	9.2 kill a monster

10. Edit the list by removing dead monsters
	10.1 check the current removeDead method
	10.2 add the getAlive methods in node and emptyNode

8. Add the ability to get only zombies 
	8.1 add a getZombies method
	8.2 abstract this out to get any monster type
