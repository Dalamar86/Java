1. Complete Java Documents.
	- The Java Docs for this assignment have been added to all relevant methods and classes.
	- They are complete with explanations fore each method including all:
		@author
		@param
		@return
		@throws
		@Before
		@Test
	- An @Test(expected) was attempted, but this did not seem to provide coverage for the 
		program even though these test passed.
2. Static splitting methods
	- Added a static version of the splitting methods which returns an array of String elements that holds the full 
		sentence.
3. Added functionality.
	- Added additional add methods:
		- addBack: adds to the end of the linked list recursively.
		- addFront: adds String to the front of the current node. Also uses boolean to determine which new node to create.
		- add(index, String): adds String at the specified index in the linked list.  Also can add sentences to any
			position of the linked list while preserving the order of the lists. 
		- remove(index): ability to remove a node by the index provided.
		- remove(String): ability to remove the first instance of the given word.
4. Abstracted Sentence Node.
	- Added an abstract Sentence node which holds all fields and most methods for the various nodes.  The word node has 
		two @Override methods, otherwise the three main nodes share the abstracted methods.
	- The empty node was only able to use two of the abstracted methods, otherwise all others had to be overridden.
